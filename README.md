# DockPanelButton
This solution shows how to control custom dock panel visibiloty by pushbutton. You will find two options. The easy one that switches visibility on and off but doesn't keep track on actual dockpanel visibility state. The medium option that also keeps track on current dockpanel visibility state. Everything is packed in App.cs for educational reasons. Keep order in your code according to God's will and don't copy/paste everything :)
